All of the links I have collected over the time related to IT, development, computer science, and plain old programming. 

## CSS
* [Object Oriented CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)
  * This is an interesting way to do CSS style sheets for large projects.
  * Not recommended for simple/small projects but you can still use it.

## Best Mailing Lists

## C# (.NET and Mono)
* [C#- Intro from MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa645597(v=vs.71).aspx)
